# ARTICLE  FOR TEAM 55 MORRA GAME FOR  THE DECENTRALIZED UMOJA 3 BOUNTY HACK.

Author: Utibe Clement Inyangetuk

Hello everyone this is my article for my project Morra Game with a wager feature. I developed this game during the 6 weeks timeframe allocated to this hackathon which was more than enough for me to complete my project.

The logic behind this game is pretty simple, two players have the ability to pick a number from 0 to 5, each player then makes a guess of the sum of his opponents number and his number, whoever gets the right guess gets his portion of the pot aka the wager. This DAPP has a similar concept to the rock paper scissors DAPP but a completely different logic and implementation.

At the beginning of the hack, I was confident that I would be able to take on the project because I have a lot of experience in web2 and a very little experience with blockchain development but  I was still very unaware of how to use reach so I went straight to the tutorials,the rock paper scissors tutorial and the wisdom for sale tutorial, although i had a lot of extracurricular activites going on in my life I was able to balance my domesitc life with anything related to my career.

While building this game, I had to dive into a lot of things about reach and I  had to understand every component needed to build the game. Intially, after going through the rock paper scissors tutorial, i started writing my first line of code for my project then I started participating in the weekly hacks,  every week I made  out time to brainstorm and solve the challenges and this went a long way in helping me understand reach.

First time I asked the community for help was when I was trying to install and set up reach for my windows os, it was a long and gruesome process from installing wsl and docker to installing ubuntu operating system, the errors there alone was enough for me to give up but I had to complete the challenge and I could not give up yet so I reached out to other devs on the help channel and they helped me out, that alone gave me the assurance that I have a community that would help  me out when I hit roadblocks and thats when I knew there was no turning back and I had to complete my project.

The only serious obstacle I had while developing this game was how to integrate the frontend and the backend, but luckily for me I came across a react boiler plate for reach dapps and which I used in my frontend and it was quite simple and less compilcated.

While using reach one amazing features that stood out to me was the verification engine and the speed at which it verifies the theorems, another point to state was the errors, for my many years as a developer I have never come across errors that are clearly stated with links to the explanation of the errors this alone reduced my developing time by 30% cause it made debugging really easy.

If I was given a chance to expand upon my  project, I would first redesign the frontend then I would  allow more players into the game using APIs.
I would like to use this oportunity to acknowledege my mentor and the reach community for being there for me when I most needed help, you all are the best.
